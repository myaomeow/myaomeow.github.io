### **AtriaConnect, Inc.** (April 2018 - Present)

#### [https://www.atriaconnect.org](https://www.atriaconnect.org),    [What is AtriaConnect? A Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-itUdRQM-c)

CEO and co-founder of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. AtriaConnect is a startup medical nonprofit centered on equipping resource-limited communities with both state-of-the-art technologies and the knowledge on how to use them. Since the group was founded in April 2018 at Caltech, we have...
  - successfully trained four Haitian physicians in a community hospital in Haiti how to incorporate point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) into their individual medical practices
  - raised over $40,000 USD in revenue to fund our organization’s work
  - been accepted into the Sling Health Accelerator Program in 2018, and presented at the 2018 USC Stevens Center for Innovation Symposium
  - established a growing network of students and doctors that spans 3 countries, 15 institutions, and 18 physicians
  - partnered with companies such as Philips Healthcare and Innovating Imaging Technologies (IIT)
  - developed an open-source electronic medical record system to faciliate patient data storage in resource-limited settings

### **MCAT Study Guide** (June 2019 - December 2019) ([Link](github.com/myaomeow/MCAT_Study_Guide_SU2019))

Publically available, condensed study guide (150 pages) written to help students prepare for the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). Used personally and by students I have tutored previously.

### **Recombination Checker** (December 2018) ([Link](github.com/myaomeow/recombination_checker))

Python program that takes a DNA sequence string and checks for potential sites of DNA recombination given a set of parameters. Takes into account minimum homology length, maximum allows homology mismatch.
