## Sample Activity Description

*Experience Name: Ballroom Dancer with Caltech Ballroom Dance Team*

I am an introvert. Sunday evenings after dinner, I enjoy meditating and getting lost in a good book. But when I step out into the spotlight and 'Swing Me Baby' begins to play, the rhythmic music feels uniquely natural and freeing. As my partner and I glide across the dancefloor, a slight push on her hand cues the next reverse turn, and she acknowledges by taking a smaller backstep on the downbeat.

As a dancer, I understand the importance of listening to these subtle features of face-to-face interaction to fully understand my partner through wordless, but not meaningless, dialogue.

Growing up, I remember listening to my father’s stories detailing the height of China’s Cultural Revolution. In the middle of the night, my father, only six years-old at the time, was roused suddenly by the shattering of his family’s heirloom vase. Frozen in fear, he tried anxiously to hide his quivering under the sheets in hopes that the ransackers would not disturb a sleeping child. My father’s early life was stricken by turmoil, and he recognized early on that his education was the only means to save him and his family. When he immigrated to America as a teenager with little money and even fewer English skills, the glimmering hope to change his life for the better shaped his—and by extension, my—perception of the American dream: to pursue education to achieve personal success and financial stability for his family. It was only through a gradual and lifelong process of self-discovery that I have been able to qualify this dream to make it uniquely my own.
