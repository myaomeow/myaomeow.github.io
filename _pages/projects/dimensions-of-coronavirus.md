title: "Dimensionality of Social Distancing during the COVID-19 Pandemic"

One property of high-dimensional $d$-space is that the volume a $d$-dimensional body is concentrated near its surface. In fact, for a $d$-dimensional unit hypersphere, the fraction $f_{\varepsilon}$ of the volume of the sphere concentrated between radius $1-\varepsilon$ and $1$ is given by

$$f_{\varepsilon}=1-(1-\varepsilon)^d$$

The link above gives the proof of this mathematical fact, but essentially, since $\varepsilon<1$, this means that $f_{\varepsilon}$ approaches unity as $d\rightarrow\infty$. 

High-dimensional systems are commonly of interest in a variety of fields of science, including (but not limited to) [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction), and [directed protein evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_evolution). It turns out that modeling systems in high dimensions can also offer us more effective ways to social distance during the 2020 [COVID-19 Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019).

> ## Collisions in High Dimensions

Because of how $f_{\varepsilon}$ behaves as a function of $d$, it turns out that as $d$ increases, collisions between objects in $d$-dimensional space become increasingly less frequent. Perhaps the easiest way to understand this is that as

Effectively, what this means is that
