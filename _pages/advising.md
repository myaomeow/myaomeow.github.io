intro: 
  - excerpt: <p style="font-size:14pt">My name is <b>Michael Yao</b> and I applied to medical school during the 2020-2021 application cycle. I graduated from Caltech in 2021 with a BS in Applied Physics, and I maintained a 4.0 GPA and scored a 520 on the MCAT in 2019 (129/129/132/130). I hope to use my expertise to help you on your path to become a physician.</p>

    title: <p align="left">How was your application cycle?</p>
    excerpt: <p align="left">I applied exclusively to MD-PhD programs in 2020 for matriculation in 2021. As a result, I learned not only how to successfully apply to and interview with medical schools, but also graduate schools at many institutions across the United States. An overview of my application trail is to the right. To give you a baseline, the average MD matriculant in the United States receives 3 interview invitations, and receives <b>less than 2</b> offers of admission. The average MD applicant applies to an average of 16 medical schools, giving an average interview invitation rate of less than 12%.</p>

    title: <p>Where did you interview?</p>
    excerpt: 'The schools that I was invited to interview at are shown to the left, half of which were first-round interviews. I understand that every school is different: some schools are strong in imaging research and integrating clinical technologies into the medical curriculum, while other schools are better at studying diabetes and community involvement. I can help you understand the unique strengths and weaknesses of each program to tailor your applications on a school-specific basis.'
