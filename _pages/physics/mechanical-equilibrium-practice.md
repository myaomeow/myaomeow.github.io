Physics problems involving mechanical equilibrium are very common in introductory physics classes. For this reason, we will practice doing a couple of these problems today.

> ## Example 1: Two Masses on an Inclined Plane

<p style="font-size:13pt"><em>This problem is adapted from Caltech's Ph1a course.</em></p>
<p style="font-size:13pt">Upon an inclined plane of angle $\theta$ is placed a block of mass $m_2$. Upon $m_2$ is placed another block of mass $m_1$. The coefficient of static friction between $m_2$ and the inclined plane is $\mu_{2s}$ and the coefficient of sliding friction is $\mu_{2k}$. Likewise, the coefficient of static friction between $m_1$ and $m_2$ is $\mu_{1s}$ and the coefficient of sliding friction is $\mu_{1k}$. A force $F$ upward and parallel to the plane is applied to $m_2$.</p>

<ol>
  <li style="font-size:13pt">What is the acceleration of $m_2$ when $m_1$ just starts to slip on it?</li>
  <li style="font-size:13pt">What is the maximum value of $F$ before this slipping takes place?</li>
</ol>

> ## Example 2: A Hanging Rope

<p style="font-size:13pt"><em>This problem is adapted from Caltech's Ph1a course.</em></p>
<p style="font-size:13pt">A rope of length $2l$ and uniform density (<em>here: mass per unit length</em>) $\rho$ is hanging over a nail in a wall with a piece of length $l$ on both sides. Friction, the thickness of the nail, and the thickness of the rope are negligible. When one creates a slight length difference between the two sides, a net force will start to act on the rope, and it will slide off the nail, faster and faster.</p>
<ol>
  <li style="font-size:13pt">When the length on one side is $l+x$ (with $0 < x < l$), what is the net force on the rope?</li>
  <li style="font-size:13pt">Find the velocity as a function of $x$. <em>Hint: make use of $\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}$.</em> What is the velocity when the rope completely comes off the nail?</li>
</ol>

> ## Example 3: Pulley on an Inclined Plane

<p style="font-size:13pt">Two blocks of mass $m$ and $M$ are connected via pulley with a configuration shown below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/images/mech-practice-3.png" alt="mech-practice-3" height="60%" width="60%"></p>
<p style="font-size:13pt">The coefficient of static friction is $\mu_s$ between the block and surface. What is the minimum and maximum mass $M$ so that no sliding occurs?</p>

> ## Example 4: Pulley on an Inclined Plane (Again)

<p style="font-size:13pt"><em>This problem is adapted from <a href="https://www.real-world-physics-problems.com/pulley-problems.html">this link</a>.</em></p>
<p style="font-size:13pt">A block of mass $M$ is pulled using a pulley at constant velocity along a surface inclined at angle $\theta$. The coefficient of kinetic friction is $\mu_k$, between block and surface. Determine the pulling force $F$.</p>

<p style="font-size:13pt"><em>This problem is adapted from <a href="https://www.real-world-physics-problems.com/pulley-problems.html">this link</a>.</em></p>
<p style="font-size:13pt">A block of mass $m$ is lifted at constant velocity using the two pulleys shown.</p>

<p style="font-size:13pt">Determine the magnitude of the pulling force $F$. Ignore the mass of the pulleys.</p>
