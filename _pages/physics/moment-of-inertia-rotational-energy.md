Recall one of Newton's Law's in the context of rotational motion that we introduced [last time](/physics/mechanical-equilibrium-revisited/index.html):

$$\sum \vec{\tau}=\vec{\tau}_{\text{net}}\propto\vec{\alpha}$$

That is, the same of all the torques on an object is proportional to the angular acceleration of the object. In this lessen, we will determine that the proportionality constant is exactly.
