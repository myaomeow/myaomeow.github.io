> ## Introduction

[Last time](/java/sets-and-hashing/index.html), we discussed the Java set interface and introduced how hashing and hash functions could be used as an efficient way to implement sets. To continue this common theme of the use cases of hashing, we'll be looking at the Java map interface today.

The Java map interface can be thought of as a dictionary (in fact, in some other programming languages it's actually called a dictionary). Let's think of what happens when we look up a word like "computer" on [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/computer):

![map-1](/assets/images/map-1.png){:height="90%" width="90%" .align-center}

Of course, given that we're programmers, we don't *actually* care about the exact definition of what a computer is. What I do want to emphasize is the layout/format of this dictionary. We have a **key**word (in this case, "computer"), which is associated with the definition or data **value** "a programmable usually electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data." In other words, there is a key-value relationship where every key has some value associated with it. A collection of key-value objects where all the keys are of a certain variable type and all the values are of a certain variable type is called a **map**.

To give another example, we can describe a map where we have the names of individuals as keys and their age as the associated values. Note that all of the keys are strings and all of the values are integers. Let's draw the map in the following way:

![map-2](/assets/images/map-2.png){:height="80%" width="80%" .align-center}

Here, this map represents 5 different people: Alice and Claire are both 17 years old, Bob is 58, Daniel is 3, and Elizabeth is 21. There's a couple things that we want to note that representative about maps in general:

  1. Note that Alice and Claire, two distinct keys, map to the same value of 17. This is completely legal, as two people can have the same age! **Two different keys can map to the same value.**
  2. However, note that the same key *cannot* map to the multiple distinct values. For example, Alice cannot be both 17 years old and 58 years old at the same time! **Every key can only map to one value.**
  3. **Every value must have a key.** As an example, we can't just have an age but have no person with that age.
  4. **Every key must have a value.** Similar to point (3) above, a person *must* have an age as well. Note that more generally, the value can be the Java ```null``` value, but regardless, this ```null``` value is still associated with the particular key.

> ## Java Implementations

Now that we have an idea of what the Java map interface looks like, we can discuss how to actually implement them in standard code. To instantiate a map instance, the Java code can look something like

```java
Map<K, V> myMap = new HashMap<>();
```

Here, ```myMap``` is the variable name of our new created map, ```K``` is the variable type of the keys in our map, and ```V``` is the variable type of the values in our map. As an example, going back to our example above on mapping ```String``` names to ```int``` ages, we can create an appropriate map using the following code:

```java
Map<String, int> namesToAges = new HashMap<>();
```

Here's a table of common methods that you can use with maps:

**Function** | **Description**
```boolean containsKey(K key)``` | Returns whether the map contains the input key ```key```
```boolean containsValue(V value)``` | Returns whether the map contains the input value ```value```
```V get(K key)``` | Returns the value associated with the key ```key```. If the key is not found in the map, then this function returns ```null```
```V put(K key, V value)``` | Adds the key-value pair of ```key``` and ```value``` to the map. If ```key``` is already present in the map, then its value is replaced with ```value```
```V remove(K key)``` | Removes the key-value pair associated with ```key``` and returns ```value```. If the key is not found in the map, then this function returns ```null```
```Set<K> keySet()``` | Returns a set of the keys in the map
```Collection<V> values()``` | Returns a collection of the values in the map

For example, to construct the map shown in the diagram [above](/java/maps-and-hashing/index.html#introduction) mapping ```String``` names to ```int``` ages, we might have code that looks something like

```java
Map<String, int> namesToAges = new HashMap<>();
namesToAges.put("Alice", 17);
namesToAges.put("Bob", 58);
namesToAges.put("Claire", 17);
namesToAges.put("Daniel", 3);
namesToAges.put("Elizabeth", 21);
```

The complete list of map interface methods can be found in the official Java documentation [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html).

> ## ```HashMap```s vs. ```Hashtable```s

From the code above, you may have seen that our chosen Java implementation of the map interface is the ```HashMap```. Another common Java implementation is the ```Hashtable```, which can be instantiated very similar to what we saw above. For example, we could have just as easily written

```java
Map<String, int> namesToAges = new Hashtable<>();
```

From the names of these implementations, you might guess that these implementations (once again) take advantage of hashing, which is correct. Similar to our discussion on sets from [last time](/java/sets-and-hashing/index.html), both ```HashMap```s and ```Hashtable```s store the key-value pairs in an array of buckets. The key-value pair is placed in the appropriate bucket as determined by the output of applying a particular hashing function on the key. Handling hashing collisions can be done through either separate chaining or open addressing, which we also discussed last time.

Both ```HashMap```s and ```Hashtable```s using hashing to store key-value pairs for fast access speeds, and their respective speeds and performances are comparable. However, there are some subtle differences between the two implementations in Java. For us, perhaps the most important thing right now is that ```HashMap```s allow for ```null``` keys and values, where ```Hashtable``` doesn't allow for any ```null``` keys or values. One disadvantage of ```HashMap```s is that ```HashMap```s do *not* allow multiple computers to concurrently modify and read from the map at the same time. For these applications, you would be forced to use ```Hashtable```s. That being said, this idea of *thread synchronization* and *concurrency* is not something that we'll have to worry about right now, so for the majority of our applications using the ```HashMap``` implementation is generally preferred.

> ## Relationship to Sets

As a side note, you might notice that there are a lot of similarities between our discussion on maps and our discussion on sets from [last time](/java/sets-and-hashing/index.html). This theme will be further echoed after completing the exercise below. The reason why this is is that a set is basically a particular version of a map where all of the values in the map are ```null``` or simply set to some dummy variable. Both are unordered collections of objects, and many of the same restrictions on the keys in maps are also valid restrictions on the elements in a set as well!

> ## Exercises

<div class="notice--success">
<p style="font-size:13pt">In the following set of exercises, you will use your understanding of the map interface and open addressing to construct a simple database to store and access the personal information of an individual.</p>
</div>

This is a fairly involved exercise and so we've tried to break it down piece by piece here. For that reason, *it is **strongly** encouraged that you go through the following problems in the order that they're presented.*

To begin, navigate to the template ```repl``` at [this link](https://repl.it/@myaomeow/Maps#Main.java). 

> ### Problem 1

If you didn't do [Problem 1](/java/sets-and-hashing/index.html#problem-1) from the last module on sets and introduction to hashing, then read about the open addressing technique for handling hashing collisions from GeeksforGeeks [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-set-3-open-addressing/).

> ### Problem 2

Navigate to the ```HashNode.java``` source code file in the ```repl``` linked above. We can think of each ```HashNode``` instance as a key-value pair, where each ```String``` key is the name of an individual and each ```String[]``` value is the data associated with that individual. Implement the functions indicated in the ```HashNode.java``` file. For the ```hashCode()``` function, be sure to implement a "well-performing" hashing function that takes in an input ```String``` name and outputs an integer. Our suggestion is to use the hashing function discussed [here](/java/sets-and-hashing/index.html#improving-hashing) for String inputs.

> ### Problem 3

Navigate to the ```MyHashMap.java``` source code file in the ```repl``` linked above. Our map will be implemented as an array of ```HashNode```s that we wrote in Problem 2 from above. Implement the remaining functions in the source code file. Handle collisions through open addressing with linear probing.

> ### Problem 4

It's finally time to run our ```repl```. If your ```HashNode.java``` and ```MyHashMap.java``` code is correct, then the code should run with no errors. Once you're done debugging, read through the driver test code in ```Main.java``` and make sure you understand what is happening. For the sake of testing the database, "names" (the keys of the map) are represented as Strings of random hexadecimal numbers, and "data" (the values of the map) are represented as the same Strings, just broken up as a String array of individual String characters.

> ### Problem 5

Running the driver test code compares the speed of the ```containsKey()``` and ```containsValue()``` functions of your ```MyHashMap.java``` map implementation with Java's official ```HashMap``` implementation. After running the code and observing the output speeds, answer the following questions:

  1. In general, which function is faster for a given implementation: ```containsKey()``` or ```containsValue()```? Can you rationalize your answer? (*Hint: Which function can take advantage of hashing?*)
  2. Because Java's implementation is written by professional programmers, we would expect our ```MyHashMap.java``` implementation to be a bit slower than the ```HashMap``` implementation. Is this what you observe?
  3. You might see that your ```containsValue()``` function is much slower than the ```containsValue()``` function from the ```HashMap``` Java implementation. Can you think of any ways to speed up your ```containsValue()``` function? We encourage you to look up this problem on Google as well!
