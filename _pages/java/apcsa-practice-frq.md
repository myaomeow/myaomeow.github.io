In the summer of 2020, I took a course at Caltech on computer science education in K-14 settings. One of my assignments was to write a mock/practice set of free-response questions (FRQs) to mimick the FRQs found on the AP Computer Science A exam for high school students. I figured that since I already wrote the questions and solutions, I would put them to good use and make them available to whoever is interested in them.
