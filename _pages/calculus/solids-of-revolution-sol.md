<p style="font-size:13pt">The following solutions are for the introductory electrostatics problems linked <a href="/calculus/solids-of-revolution/index.html#exercises">here</a>. I encourage you to attempt them by yourself first before looking through the solutions.</p>

> ## Problem 1

<div class="notice--info">
<p style="font-size:13pt">Using a method similar to our derivation of the washer method above, derive a similar formula to calculate the <em>surface area</em> of a solid of revolution.</p>
</div>

Similar to the washer method for calculating volume, we will subdivide the solid of revolution as a stack of washers, each now with surface area $$2\pi rh$$. In this case $r$ is $f(x)$ and $h$ is $dx$, and so the surface area $\mathcal{S}$ of a solid of revolution constructed by rotating the planar region between $y=f(x)$, the $x$-axis, $x=a$ and $x=b$ is given by

<div class="notice--success">
<p style="font-size:13pt">$$\mathcal{S}=2\pi\int_a^b f(x)dx$$</p>
</div>

Of course, if $\mathcal{S}$ is a closed surface, then we also should add on the surface area contributions from the circular bases at $x=a$ and $x=b$:

<div class="notice--success">
<p style="font-size:13pt">$$\mathcal{S}=2\pi\int_a^b f(x)dx+\pi f(a)^2+\pi f(b)^2$$</p>
</div>
