To wrap up our work with derivatives, I've included a set of free response questions for every major topic involving limits, continuity, and derivatives. Go through these problems for review. The answer key and explanations for all of the problems on this page can be found [here].

> ## Limits and Continuity

> ### Problem 1

_This problem is adapted from [SAUSD](https://www.sausd.us/cms/lib/CA01000471/Centricity/Domain/2330/FRQ%20Review%201_w_Teacher%20Notes.pdf)._

![derivatives-wrap-up-2](/assets/images/derivatives-wrap-up-2.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}

$f$ has a discontinuity due to a vertical asymptote at $x=6$. Let $g$ be a function that is continuous and increasing for all $x$. Values of $g(x)$ at selected values of $x$ are shown in the table below.

$x$ | -0.2 | -0.1 | -0.01 | -0.001 | 0.001 | 0.01 | 0.1 | 0.2
$g(x)$ | 1.975 | 1.988 | 1.997 | 1.999 | 2.001 | 2.003 | 2.012 | 2.025

  1. Using the graph of $f$ and the table for $g$, estimate $$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\left[f(x)-g(x)\right]$$.
  2. For each value of $a=1, a=2, a=4, a=6$, find $\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)$ or explain why $\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)$ does not exists. Use correct limit notation in your answers.
  3. If $f$ continuous at $x=-3$? Using correct limit notation, justify your answer.
  4. Write a difference quotient that best approximates the instantaneous rate of change of $g$ at $x=0$.
