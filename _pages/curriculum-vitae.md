> ## Projects

### **AtriaConnect, Inc.** (April 2018 - Present)

_[What is AtriaConnect? A Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-itUdRQM-c)_

CEO and co-founder of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. [AtriaConnect](https://www.atriaconnect.org) is a startup medical nonprofit centered on equipping resource-limited communities with both state-of-the-art technologies and the knowledge on how to use them. Since the group was founded in April 2018 at Caltech, we have...
  - successfully trained four Haitian physicians in a community hospital in Haiti how to incorporate point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) into their individual medical practices
  - raised over $40,000 USD in revenue to fund our organization’s work
  - been accepted into the Sling Health Accelerator Program in 2018, and presented at the 2018 USC Stevens Center for Innovation Symposium
  - established a growing network of students and doctors that spans 3 countries, 15 institutions, and 18 physicians
  - partnered with companies such as Philips Healthcare and Innovating Imaging Technologies (IIT)

### **Chatter** (May 2020 - Present)

_[Landing Page (In Progress)](https://chatter-usc.github.io)_

Website and mobile iOS app to make information on contraceptives more accessible. Users are able to see what their (anonymized) social media contacts and community members use for birth control and sexual health. By making contraceptive usage data more transparent and easily accessible, we hope to encourage more engaged conversations between patients and their healthcare providers. This project is a collaboration between the [USC EMERGE Lab](https://www.theemergelab.com) and [AtriaConnect](https://www.atriaconnect.org). Written using ```Swift```, ```Xcode```, ```Firebase```, ```HTML/CSS```, and ```Jekyll```.

### **Dimensions of Social Distancing for COVID-19** (July 2020)

Using computational modeling and analytical methods from thermodynamics, I demonstrated [here](/projects/dimensions-of-coronavirus/index.html) that more effective social distancing measures could be put in place even if only a small percentage of the population socially distances.

### **Recombination Checker** (June 2020)

This [Java program](/projects/plasmid-homology-analyzer/index.html) takes a DNA sequence string and checks for potential sites of DNA recombination given a set of parameters. It takes into account minimum homology length, maximum allows homology mismatch, and predicted DNA secondary structures to output potential sites where DNA could be excised due to sequence homology.

### **MCAT Study Guide** (June 2019 - December 2019)

Publicly available, condensed [study guide](https://www.github.com/myaomeow/MCAT_Study_Guide_SU2019) (150 pages) written to help students prepare for the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). Used personally and by students I have tutored previously.
