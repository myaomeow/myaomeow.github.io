Education is important. In working with high school students and college undergraduates, I have developed a number of teaching materials on a variety of topics ranging from computer science and mathematics to physics and chemistry. These are by no means comprehensive, but can serve as helpful review guides and/or topic outlines for current students.

### Java

  1. [Getting Started](/java/getting-started/index.html)
  2. [Fields and Methods](/java/fields-and-methods/index.html)
  3. [Variables, Conditionals, and Loops](/java/variables-conditionals-and-loops/index.html)

### Calculus

  1. [Limits and Continuity](/calculus/limits-and-continuity/index.html)

### Physics (with Calculus)
  
  1. [Newton's Laws and Kinematics](/physics/newton-laws-and-kinematics/index.html)
  2. [Mechanical Equilibrium](/physics/mechanical-equilibrium/index.html)
  3. [Friction](/physics/friction/index.html)
