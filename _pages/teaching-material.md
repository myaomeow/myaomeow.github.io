Education is important. In working with high school students and college undergraduates, I have developed a number of teaching materials on a variety of topics ranging from computer science and mathematics to physics and chemistry. These are by no means comprehensive, but can serve as helpful review guides and/or topic outlines for current students.

### Java

  1. [Getting Started](/java/getting-started/index.html)
  2. [Fields and Methods](/java/fields-and-methods/index.html)
  3. [Variables, Conditionals, and Loops](/java/variables-conditionals-and-loops/index.html)
  4. [Lists and ```ArrayList```s](/java/lists-and-arrays/index.html)
  5. [```LinkedList```s and Matrices](/java/linked-lists-and-matrices/index.html)
  6. [Abstraction](/java/abstraction/index.html)

### Calculus

  1. [Limits and Continuity](/calculus/limits-and-continuity/index.html)
  2. [Introduction to Derivatives](/calculus/intro-to-derivatives/index.html)
  3. [Evaluating Derivatives](/calculus/evaluating-derivatives/index.html)
  4. [Higher Order Derivatives](/calculus/higher-order-derivatives/index.html)
  5. [The Chain Rule](/calculus/chain-rule/index.html)

### Physics (with Calculus)
  
  1. [Newton's Laws and Kinematics](/physics/newton-laws-and-kinematics/index.html)
  2. [Mechanical Equilibrium](/physics/mechanical-equilibrium/index.html)
  3. [Friction](/physics/friction/index.html)
  4. [Pulleys](/physics/pulleys/index.html)
  5. [Mechanical Equilibrium Practice](/physics/mechanical-equilibrium-practice/index.html)
  6. [Springs and Harmonic Oscillation](/physics/springs-and-sho/index.html)

### Introduction to Statistical Learning

These notes are based on a publicly available course offered by Professor [Konstantin Zuev](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~zuev/index.html) at Caltech on statistical learning.

  1. [Learning Problems and Statistical Decision Theory](/stat-learning/lecture-1/index.html)
