In this section, we will talk about dynamic memory allocation in C, including the function ```malloc()``` and other related methods.

> ## Static Memory Allocation

Consider the following line of code in C.

```c
int x = 3;
```

As we have seen previously, all local variables are stored somewhere on the stack in primary storage, including the variable ```x``` above. When compiling the C source code to convert it into an executable, what happens is that the compiler tells the computer to allocate (i.e. set aside) space (on the stack) for this particular local variable. This operation is done before the program executes. In these cases for our standard set of local primitive variables like ```int```s and ```char```s, we can see that we cannot allocate variables through this method _while_ the program is executing. This form of memory management is called **static memory allocation**.

> ## Dynamic Memory Allocation

In certain cases, we may want the flexibility of being able to allocate computer memory _during_ run time instead of before run time during the compilation process. This form of memory management is called **dynamic memory allocation**. Dynamic memory allocation can only allocate memory from the [heap](/computing-systems/x86-assembly-p1/index.html#primary-storage-memory-stacks-and-heaps) as opposed to the stack. The benefit of dynamic memory allocation is that we can often improve the space utilization of computer resources through effective dynamic memory management, but a downside is that the program may run a bit slower than if implemented in some other way because access times to the heap are often slower than access times to the stack.

> ### ```malloc()```

In C, dynamic memory allocation is accomplished using the ```malloc()``` library, which is included in the ```stdlib.h``` C library header file. This function

```c
void *malloc(size_t size)
```

alllocates ```size``` bytes of memory from the heap and returns a ```void *``` pointer to the allocated memory address. If it happens that the heap has no additional space, then the function returns ```NULL``` since the request failed. As an example, ```malloc()``` can be used to store a String, which is simply an array of ```char```s in C:

```c
char *str = (char *)malloc(17); // Our string will have 17 characters.
strcpy(str, "This is a string!");
printf("%s\n", str, str);
```

If you are unfamiliar with the ```strcpy()``` function, I encourage you to check the documentation out [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strcpy.htm). This above code would print out ```This is a string!``` to ```stdout```. 

> ### ```calloc()```

The C library function ```calloc()``` is very similar to ```malloc()``` and is also used to dynamic memory allocation, usually for arrays with a predetermined number of elements. For example, let's say that we want to allocate memory for ```n``` array elements that are ```size``` bytes each. The ```calloc()``` function does this as

```c
void *calloc(size_t n, size_t size)
```

and returns a ```void *``` pointer to the beginning of the array (or ```NULL``` if the request fails). So, ```malloc()``` and ```calloc()``` are essentially identical if you set ```n = 1```. However, a major difference is that ```malloc()``` simply returns a pointer to the beginning of the memory chunk, while ```calloc()``` returns a pointer to the beginning of the memory chunk _and also zeroes out the allocated memory space_. This means that the memory space is guaranteed to be filled with zero bits after the ```calloc()``` method call.

> ### ```realloc()```

```realloc()``` is a standard C library function that resizes the memory block pointed to by ```ptr``` that was previously allocated with ```malloc()``` (or ```calloc()```). The function

```c
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)
```

returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory, or ```NULL``` if the request fails. ```ptr``` is the pointer to the memory block previously allocated with ```malloc()``` or ```calloc()```, while ```size``` is the new size for the memory block, in bytes. If ```ptr``` is ```NULL```, then ```realloc()``` is exactly the same as ```malloc()```. If ```size``` is ```0```, then ```realloc()``` is exactly the same as ```free()```.

> ### ```free()```

Just as we have to explicitly use the ```malloc()``` function to dynamically _allocate_ memory during run time, we also need to dynamically _deallocate_ (or free) memory during run time after we are done with a particular memory chunk in the heap. This is important for good space utilization of computer resources. This is accomplished using the ```free()``` function, which is also included in the ```stdlib.h``` C library header file. This function

```c
void free(void *ptr)
```

will free a memory chunk previously allocated by a call of ```malloc()```, ```realloc()```, or ```calloc()```. The argument ```ptr``` is a pointer to the memory block that we want to free. If ```NULL``` is passed in as the argument, then nothing happens.

> ## Behind the Scenes

In the remaining part of this lesson, we will be going over the different memory management algorithms and how ```malloc()``` explicitly works "under the hood."

> ### Important Parameters

As always, we'll imagine the heap as an array of blocks (that are each 8-bytes large on 64-bit systems). Because of various ```malloc()``` calls, at any given point, the state of the heap may look something like this, for instance:

![malloc-1](/assets/images/computer-systems/malloc-1.png)
_Diagram taken from [this link](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/10sp/lectures/15-memallocation.pdf). Note that_ ```word```_s should instead be_ ```quadword```_s because our blocks are 8-byte aligned._

As you can see here, at any given point in time we might have some sequence of allocated and deallocated "chunks" of memory that can be of varying and unknown lengths (since they are defined by the user). What are our goals for an effective ```malloc()``` implementation? There are primarily two things that we're interested in:

  1. **Throughput**: This is the _number of completed_ ```malloc()``` _requests per unit time_. Essentially, how fast is our ```malloc()``` implementation? Note that this feature also somewhat depends on how fast the CPU of your computer is, and so when testing the throughput of ```malloc()```, it is important to consistently use one standardized machine and run multiple tests for statistical significance. 
  2. **Peak Memory Utilization**: While _throughput_ is a measure of time efficiency, peak memory utilization can be thought of as a measure of space and computer resource efficiency. Consider some sequence of ```malloc()``` and ```free()``` requests:

$$R_0, R_1, \ldots, R_k, \ldots, R_{n-1}$$

We define the _aggregate payload_ $P_k$ is the collective size of all of the currently allocated payloads after request $R_k$ has been completed. Meanwhile, the _current heap size_ is $H_k$ and is assumed to be monotonically nondecreasing. Our allocator can increase the size of the heap using the ```sbrk()``` function, discussed [below](/computing-systems/malloc/index.html#sbrk). The peak memory utilization after $k$ requests $U_k$ is therefore defined as

$$U_k=\frac{\text{max}_{i<k} P_i}{H_k}$$

Our goal in writing a ```malloc()``` implementation is to maximize throughput and peak memory utilization. However, as we will see, this can often become quite a challenging task.

> ### Fragmentation

Consider the following allocation example:

![malloc-2](/assets/images/computer-systems/malloc-2.png)
_Diagram taken from [this link](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/10sp/lectures/15-memallocation.pdf)._

This example illustrates the two types of **memory fragmentation** that can result in poor peak memory utilization. Put simply, _fragmentation_ occurs whenever there is free memory in between two allocated memory chunks, because the presence of the free memory chunk _fragments_ the contiguity of allocated memory. In this section, we'll talk about each of these types of fragmentation. 

> #### Internal Fragmentation

Consider the second malloc call for ```p2``` from the example above:

```c
void *p2 = malloc(4 * QUAD + 2);
```

Based on the ```malloc()``` argument, we only needed 34 bytes of memory, but the allocator gave us 40 bytes based on the diagram. This is because the allocator cannot give us a "fractional" memory block, because everything must be 8-byte aligned. In other words memory chunks can only come allocated in integer multiples of 8 bytes. 

What happens as a result? Let's take a look at the allocated memory block more closely:

![malloc-3](/assets/images/computer-systems/malloc-3.png)

What is happening here is that in this case, _padding_ for alignment purposes has resulted in **internal fragmentation** because the payload is smaller than the block size, and so there is a chunk of memory 6 bytes large that is being unused. Internal fragmentation can often be caused by:

  1. padding for alignment purposes (what we just discussed)
  2. overhead of maintaining heap data structures (to be discussed)
  3. explicit policy decisions (e.g. we might decide the minimum block size should be 16 bytes, and a user wants to ```malloc()``` only a single byte)

Notice that internal fragmentation depends only on the pattern of the current and previous requests, and so this type of fragmentation is fairly easy to measure quantitatively.

> #### External Fragmentation

Contrast to internal fragmentation is **external fragmentation**, which occurs when there is enough aggregate heap memory, but no single free block is large enough. For example, let's go back to our previous color-coded ```malloc()``` diagram from above:

![malloc-2](/assets/images/computer-systems/malloc-2.png)
_Diagram taken from [this link](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/10sp/lectures/15-memallocation.pdf)._

Imagine that after the last ```p4``` ```malloc()``` call, we have the following memory allocation call:

```c
void *p5 = malloc(4 * QUAD);
```

This means that we want our allocator to allocate to us a single chunk of memory that is 4 8-bytes large. We have 5 blocks of memory available and certainly have enough space available to satisfy this request, but the problem is that no _single_ free chunk of memory is able satisfy this request, as the only two free chunks above have 3 blocks and 2 blocks, respectively. Because a ```malloc()``` call must return a pointer to a single, contiguous memory space, the request will fail. This is an example of external fragmentation.

Note that the extent of fragmentation depends on the pattern of _future_ allocation and deallocation requests, and so this type of fragmentation is fairly difficult to measure. As we will see down the road, there is often a tradeoff between these two types of fragmentation.

> ### Keeping Track of Free Blocks

An allocator must have some way to keep track of the free blocks still available to be allocated. There are a number of different ways to accomplish this, but we'll discuss the two most basic methods here.

> #### Implicit List

An implicit list works by storing the sizes of each of the chunks of memory in the first 8-byte block of the payload, which we'll refer to as **overhead** storage. By knowing how large an allocated or free block is, we're able to know how far to "jump" to get to the next chunk of memory.

![malloc-4](/assets/images/computer-systems/malloc-4.png)

In the overhead, we would also likely set aside a single bit to let us keep track of whether the memory block is allocated or not. Therefore, within a single quadword memory block, we could have a single "allocation flag" that is either ```1``` or ```0``` to keep track of whether the block is allocated, and the remaining 63 bits can be used to keep track of the size. Note that this overhead would increase the amount of implicit fragmentation since an 8-byte block will always be used to store information about the memory chunk and not to store a payload, but this is necessary in order for us to keep track of which blocks are free or not.

> #### Explicit List

From above, implicit lists worked by allowing us to go through each of the memory chunks one by one and check if each was allocated or not. In contrast to this method, we can have an **explicit list** of free blocks, which essentially uses something analogous to a linked list to store the free blocks.

![malloc-5](/assets/images/computer-systems/malloc-5.png)

Now, our overhead for each block must include not only the size and allocation bits of the blocks, but also an additional 8 bytes that store a pointer to the next free block in the heap.

> #### More Advanced Techniques

There are more advanced techniques to keep track of free blocks than implicit and explicit lists, but we will not discuss them here. Two of the most common ones are perhaps the segregated free list and sorting blocks based on size. For convenience, we will not discuss them here, but you are free to read about them at [this link](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/10sp/lectures/15-memallocation.pdf).

> ### Free Block Search Algorithms

> #### Implicit List

For implicit lists, there are three common ways to search through the heap to find the next free block.

  1. **First Fit Algorithm**: This method searches the heap from the beginning and finds the first free block that fits the requested size. It can often be fairly fast (especially compared to best fit), but can often cause a large amount of external fragmentation at the beginning of the list.
  2. **Next Fit Algorithm**: This method is similar to first fit, but instead of searching the heap from the beginning, it starts searching from where the previous search finished. This is probably the fastest of the three methods because it avoids re-scanning unhelpful blocks, but coincidentally, some research actually suggests that its fragmentation is the worse out of the three algorithms.
  2. **Best Fit Algorithm**: This method choices the _best_ free block, which is simply an unallocated block with the fewest bytes left over that still fits the requested size. Because of the optimal fit, this method keeps fragmentation minimal, but it will typically run much slower than the other two methods because you must search through the entire heap every time in order to determine the "best fit."

As you can see based on these three algorithms, there is often a trade-off between peak memory utilization (space efficiency) and throughput (time efficiency). This makes choosing an "optimal" ```malloc()``` implementation often very difficult.
