Hello! I'm a current junior at Caltech studying physics and computer science. I'm born and raised in California and am the oldest child in a family of four (six if you count two dogs!)

I am interested in how fundamental physical principles can be used to explain and model complex biological systems and their interaction with matter. I'm aspiring to become a physician-scientist to advance our understanding of both science and medicine.

  1. Honored to be receiving the [Jack E. Froehlich Award](https://deans.caltech.edu/Grants_Funding/Froehlich) in memory of the late Jack E. Froehlich, who did his undergraduate and graduate work at Caltech and was later the project manager for Explorer I for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The award of $1,500 is given to a junior in the upper 5% of his or her class who shows outstanding promise for a creative professional career.

  2. I am grateful to be recognized as a [2020 Henry Ford II Scholar Award](http://eas.caltech.edu/news/1309) recipient. This award of $5,000 is funded under an endowment provided by the Ford Motor Company Fund, and is made annually to engineering students with the best academic record at the end of the third year of undergraduate study.

  3. Happy to announce that [AtriaConnect](https://www.atriaconnect.org/)'s collaboration with the Alma Mater Hospital in Gros-Morne, Haiti has been accepted for publication in [POCUS Journal](https://pocusjournal.com/)! Our work will be featured in the upcoming issue, but check out the preprint on [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095760v1) now.

  1. Humbled to be the recipient of Caltech's Scholarship funded by the Richter Memorial Fund in honor of Paul K. Richter and Evalyn E. Cook. This generous merit-based award helps to cover over 60% of my tuition fees.

  2. I am the recipient of the McLean Scholarship awarded by Caltech. Grateful for all of Caltech's support and assistance throughout the past three years.

  1. Excited to announce that a paper published by Dr. Anna Maw, one of [AtriaConnect](https://www.atriaconnect.org/)'s volunteer physicians, has been published in [Diagnostics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31635219/). Our work discusses some of the stakeholder perceptions in implementing point-of-care ultrasound training in resource-limited settings.
